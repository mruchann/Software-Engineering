            \subitem \textbf{-} Users who try to help others, such as doctors, winch operators, veterinarians, and so on.
            \subitem \textbf{-} Users who try to find help on the site, i.e, people who were affected by the earthquake.
        \item Government organizations such as AFAD are making use of this website for finding missing people, reported by trusted sources.
        \item Developers: Developers are highly active in GitHub, they give full support to the open source project on GitHub. In the early stages, they work almost full-time for the website.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Regulatory Policies}: The system doesn't hold any critical personal information, such as credit card numbers, therefore
        
        \item \textbf{Hardware Limitations}: The system heavily relies on CDN's, so the Data Centers should always be up and running, there should be enough memory and disk space in the cloud computers.
        
        \item \textbf{Interfaces to other systems}: afetbilgi.com should be compatible with all the systems that it is interacting with, such as Google Maps API, PDF Conversion Service and Google Docs Interface. 
        
        \item \textbf{High-Level Language Requirements}: Due to rapid changes and feature needs, as well as supporting all of the devices, high-level languages like Python or JVM languages like Java should be used.
        
        \item \textbf{Parallel Operations}: Concurrency and multi-threading are problematic, the system should not assume that a device can do multiple tasks at a time, it should design the system such that they are no parallel operations because of the hardware limitations.
        
        \item \textbf{Quality Requirements}: Should be reliable and secure, the system shall have backup databases. Quality assurance tests must be conducted every week.
        
        \item \textbf{Criticality of application}: System failure could be life-threatening for someone, since the information that the site provides is extremely useful in certain life-threatening scenarios.

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Suggestions to improve the existing system}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chatbot}: It is better to provide a chatbot at the bottom right of the website so that users can easily navigate between what they need, rather than searching through and discovering all the buttons. An artificial intelligence API should be used, or a machine learning model should be trained.
    
    \item \textbf{Translation}: Since Turkey is a popular tourist attraction, German, Russian or French, Spanish, Italian, and other the most spoken languages should be added. Furthermore, since the translation is provided by static HTML files, there are some translation issues. A translation API can be used.

    \item \textbf{News Feed}: This website lacks a user-friendly News Feed interface with the latest news from trusted sources. It can serve as a daily news digest. It's better for people to see the news in a more interactive way.

    \item \textbf{Dark mode}: Dark mode is a trend these days because of its effect on battery life and eyes. It should be added and integrated into the website smoothly.

    \item \textbf{WhatsApp support line}: Email support is great but if we consider the hurry and rush in the disaster area, WhatsApp would be faster, and it is much more common than email. In addition, we can learn if the message is delivered to the recipient. In Turkey, no one sends emails very frequently, but they send WhatsApp messages.

    \item \textbf{Improve front-end components and widgets}: Although the website is fast because it has fewer UI components, the trade-off is not in the optimal case. It can be more cleaner and user-friendly. The buttons are clustered in such a way that sometimes users cannot find what they want at first look.
    
\end{itemize}

\section{System Perspective}

afetbilgi.com interacts with Google Maps, Google Docs, AWS, Cloudflare, PDF Conversion service, CDN, trusted sources, and more. In the improved version, in addition to the current version, afetbilgi.com interacts with Translation API for supporting more languages, with fewer bugs caused by static HTML files, and OpenAPI for a fully functional Chatbot that meets users' demands quickly and effectively. Furthermore, using trusted sources, the news feed represents the data in a more organized and user-friendly way. Users see the most breaking news on the home page of the website. The dark mode is added in and integrated with all the components of the website smoothly. Also, our system has a Whatsapp support line, which redirects users to the Whatsapp chat when they need something as well as want to report something. Although it does not solely improve the functionality of the system, the new system has better front-end and functional widgets.

\section{External Interfaces}

The following class diagram represents the relationship between new application programming interfaces and their new functionalities. \\

\textbf{Translation API} \\


Users can see all the Information List Interfaces, Google Maps Interfaces, Google Docs Interfaces, Topic Selection Interfaces and finally generated PDFs in their language thanks to the Translation API. It handles all the complex text and generates the response very quickly. However, in the old version, everything was not integrated into the translation, and they were several interfaces that does not have language support. Even if we select a specific language, they are a lot of text in Turkish, which is not convenient for foreign users. For example, maps.afetbilgi.com does not have any language support. Translation API solves this. \\

\textbf{OpenAI API} \\


The system needs some artificial assistance for users to make their life easier and help them find what they are looking for. OpenAI is known for its very complex and high-performance servers and models.  Therefore, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. We can trust and rely on this API. Searching all through the website and trying to find what they need is very cumbersome for especially the people in rural areas, elders, children, and so on. Chatbot powered by OpenAI solves this problem efficiently.
